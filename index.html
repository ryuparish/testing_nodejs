    <h2>Personal information and other logistic about the student</h2>
            <pre id="Personal Information">
            In the first portion of a college application, students
            will have to provide basic information about themselves, their
            school and their family.

            Input your name, email address, phone number, high school,
            college credits already earned, standardized test scores,
            citizenship information, etc. 
            </pre>
    <h2>High School Transcript</h2>
            <pre id="High School Transcript">
            Colleges will also ask for an official high school transcript,
            which is a record of the courses students have taken and the grades they have earned.

            Admissions offices typically ask that a transcript be sent directly
            from the high school rather than from the student, says Geoff Heckman,
            school counselor and department chair at Platte County High School in Missouri.
            Usually, students submit a transcript request to their high school's counseling office.
            </pre>
    <h2>Standardized test scores including the SAT, ACT, and the AP exams.</h2>
            <pre id="Standardized Test Scores">
            Many schools require applicants to submit SAT or ACT scores. These scores are usually sent by the testing companies.
            The number of schools requiring standardized test scores has dropped dramatically as the coronavirus pandemic
            upended these exams, with many testing centers closed across the U.S. in parts of 2020.

            Prospective students should know, however, that testing policies vary even when such exams are not required.
            Key terms to pay attention to include test-blind and test-optional. Test-blind means that scores will not be
            considered if submitted. By contrast, test-optional colleges do not require ACT or SAT scores but will consider
            them if submitted as part of an application.
